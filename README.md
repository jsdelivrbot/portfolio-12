Hello there. Welcome to my portfolio backup. If you can see this, you're either me, or you aren't welcome here. I'm not sure how you got here but please go away. Thank you \^_^

1. Open TextEdit and create a new file
2. Convert it to plain text by clicking Format > Make Plain Text
3. Add your commands, one per line. For example, you could do:
	#! /bin/bash
	cd ~/Desktop
	mkdir myCoolFolder
	cd myCoolFolder

4. Run chmod u+x ~/Desktop/myCommandScript.command in your terminal, where ~/Desktop/myCommandScript.command is the path to your script. This will give the terminal permission to run the file.

5. You're done! Double-click the file to run. Dragging over the terminal icon will also work.
